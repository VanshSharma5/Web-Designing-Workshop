        Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching, designing,
        developing and testing of electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics and
        Communications engineers also conceptualize and oversee the manufacturing of communications
        and broadcast systems. This stream of engineering deals with analog transmission, basic electronics,
        microprocessors, solid state devices, digital & analog communication, analogintegrated circuits,
        microwave engineering, satellite communication, antenna and wave propagation. It also deals with
        the manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment. This branch of
        engineering also plays a vital role ensuring fastest means of communication across the world.
